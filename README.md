# Data Vizualization
### DataExplorer

- Quick intuitive vizualizations (creates an html report in one line)

### Esquise

- Quickly create ggplot2 graphs(shiny) which can be exported(code-wise)

# Machine learning

### MLR

- One of the biggest reasons Python surged ahead of R was thanks to its machine learning focused libraries (like scikit-learn). For a long time, R lacked this ability. Sure you could use different packages for performing different ML tasks but there was no one package that could do it all. We had to call three different libraries for building three different models.

### parsnip

- A common issue with different functions available in R (that do the same thing) is that they can have different interfaces and arguments. Take the random forest algorithm for example. The code you would use in the randomforest package and the caret package are different, right?

Like MLR, parsnip removes the problem of referring to multiple packages for a certain machine learning algorithm. It successfully imitates Python’s scikit-learn package in R. (good for regresion)

### Ranger

- Ranger is one of my favorite R packages. I regularly use random forests to build baseline models – especially when I’m participating in data science hackathons.

Here’s a question – how many times have you encountered slow random forest computation for huge datasets in R? It happens way too often on my old machine.

Packages like caret, random forests and rf take a lot of time to compute the results. The ‘Ranger’ package accelerates our model building process for the random forest algorithm. It helps you swiftly create a large number of trees in less amount of time.**Very quick**
